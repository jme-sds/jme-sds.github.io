Hello, I'm John Michael Epperson

I am a Data Scientist and Physicist based in Charlottesville, VA. My work sits at the intersection of rigorous statistical modeling and modern deep learning.
Currently, I am pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of Virginia, where I focus on building AI systems that are not just theoretically interesting, but practically useful.

## What I Do

I specialize in Deep Learning, Generative AI, and Computer Vision. My background in Physics has instilled in me a "first-principles" approach to data—I don't just run models; I try to understand the underlying mechanics of the system I am studying.

My professional background includes designing automated ETL pipelines, building custom R libraries for industrial testing, and managing data quality in highly regulated environments. I enjoy the challenge of taking messy, real-world data and architecting the databases and workflows required to turn it into insight.

## Featured Projects

My recent research focuses on applying AI to civic and environmental challenges:

* RAG for Civic Engagement: I developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that allows residents to query the Charlottesville municipal code using natural language. The system benchmarks competitively against industry standards (LegalBenchRAG).
* Computer Vision for Ecology: As part of the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge, I implemented self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViT) to tackle the difficult problem of multi-label plant classification, using advanced tiling strategies to detect species in complex environments.
* Humanitarian AI: I have worked on machine learning models designed to detect blue tarps in aerial imagery, aiding in rapid disaster assessment and relief efforts.

## The Analog & The Digital

When I step away from the GPU, I tend to go to one of two extremes: purely analog or deeply networked.

### Film Photography

I shoot on a Minolta SRT 101, primarily using Kodak Gold 200. There is something satisfying about the mechanical nature of the camera and the patience required by film—it’s a refreshing contrast to the instant feedback of model training.

### Home Lab & Self-Hosting

I am an avid self-hoster and network tinkerer, managing a distributed fleet of hardware to ensure data sovereignty and network security:

* The Server (Repurposed Laptop): My primary node running Docker containers for Nextcloud (private cloud storage) and Pi-hole (network-wide ad/tracker blocking).
* Raspberry Pi 3B: Dedicated to BirdNET-Pi, an acoustic monitoring station that uses machine learning to identify and log local bird species.
* Orange Pi 3 Zero: Configured as a dedicated hotspot bridge. It creates a Wi-Fi access point that routes traffic from connected edge devices (which cannot install Tailscale natively) directly through my secure tailnet.
* Networking: I utilize Tailscale to knit these devices together, allowing secure remote access without exposing ports to the public internet.
